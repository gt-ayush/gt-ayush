# Hi, I'm Ayush 👋

I am a Persistence-Driven Developer and Linux enthusiast who loves low-level logic and high-level automation.

### ⚡ Quick Stats
- 🐧 **OS:** Linux (Arch/Manjaro) is my home; the terminal is my office.
- 🚀 **Fast Learner:** Taught myself the C language in 12 hours. 
- 🛠️ **Resourceful:** Once built a full billing system using Python and Excel as a database when SQL wasn't an option.

### 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** C, Python, Java, JavaScript, Shell Scripting, HTML/CSS.
- **Infrastructure:** Linux SysAdmin, DNS (PowerDNS, BIND, Technitium), BIOS/UEFI.
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB.
- **Currently Learning:** Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) & Security Scanning Orchestration.

### 🔭 My Philosophy
"If you haven't done it hands-on, you don't know it yet." I specialize in taking raw terminal data and turning it into documented, functional systems.
